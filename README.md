# Personal Budget Planner - Excel Dashboard

Welcome to the **Personal Monthly Budget Planner**, an Excel-based project designed to help individuals 
track, manage, and analyze their monthly income and expenses in a visually engaging and insightful way. 
This dashboard was built using core Excel skills including formulas, pivot tables, and data visualization.

## Objective

## How It Works

### Sheet 1: `Transactions & Calculations`
- Users enter transaction details manually.
- Each transaction is categorized as:
  - **Expense**
  - **Bill**
  - **Saving**
- Dynamic tables calculate:
  - Total amount per category
  - Category-wise percentages of total income
  - Monthly summaries

### Sheet 2: `Dashboard`
- All aggregated values are linked to dynamic visual elements.
- Charts and KPIs automatically update based on the transaction data.
- Provides a **comprehensive monthly financial overview** at a glance.

## Excel Skills Used

- Data Validation for category entries
- IF, SUMIFS, and PERCENTAGE formulas
- Dynamic named ranges and tables
- Linked visuals using cell references
- Chart customization for professional design

## Why This Dashboard Stands Out

- Fully dynamic – update one sheet and everything else adjusts automatically.
- Clean and colorful design – easy to follow even for non-technical users.
- Scalable – can be extended to cover multiple months or additional financial metrics.
